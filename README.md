# Restaurant Website Rpoject
This is a repository for a Restaurant Website project built using modern web development technologies. The website is designed to showcase a restaurant's menu, location, hours of operation, and other important information.

The website is built using a responsive design that works seamlessly across different devices, including desktops, tablets, and mobile phones. It also includes a dynamic menu system that allows restaurant owners to easily update their menu items and prices.

The website is built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap, making it easy to customize and extend as needed. It also includes integration with Google Maps to provide easy directions to the restaurant's location.

This project serves as a great example of how to build a modern, responsive website for a restaurant. Whether you are a restaurant owner looking to build your own website or a web developer looking to learn new skills, this repository is a valuable resource.

Feel free to clone or fork the repository and use it as a starting point for your own restaurant website project.
